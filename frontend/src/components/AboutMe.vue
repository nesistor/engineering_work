    <h1>Hi I'm Karol</h1>
    <p>My life is a mix of culture, knowledge and innovative ideas. I like discovering new tools. Feel free to be a DevOps, Backend Developer or Flutter Developer.
      I am very attentive in what I do. I look at the work and think about the many things that need to be implemented in it to prevent future problems. I am self-critical and often try to do everything efficiently.</p>
