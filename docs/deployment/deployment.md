# Documentation for Deploying an Application to the Cloud using Jenkins and Helm Chart

## Introduction

This documentation describes the process of deploying an application to the cloud using Jenkins and Helm Chart. The configuration includes the use of HashiCorp Vault for secrets management, Consul for service discovery, and Google Cloud KMS for securing Vault encryption keys.

## Helm Chart Configuration

Below is the configuration of the individual application components in the `values.yaml` file:

### Vault

*   Image version: HashiCorp Vault 1.18.2
*   Use of the Vault agent with automatic generation of JWT keys
*   HA configuration using Consul
*   Enabled "transit" backend for managing encryption keys
*   Securing encryption keys using Google Cloud KMS
*   Defining ports and environment variables
*   Mounting volumes for data and configuration

### Consul

*   Image version: HashiCorp Consul 1.15.1
*   3 replicas to ensure high availability
*   Configuration of ports and environment variables
*   Mounting volumes for data

### Application services

*   Defined image versions and environment variables for individual services
*   Use of DNS-based URLs for communication between services
*   Configuration of ports and environment variables specific to each service

## Jenkinsfile

The process of deploying the application using Jenkins is defined in the `Jenkinsfile` file. Below is a sample script:

```groovy
pipeline {
    agent any
    stages {
        stage('Build') {
            steps {
                // Building Docker images
                // ...
            }
        }
        stage('Deploy') {
            steps {
                // Logging in to the Kubernetes cluster
                // ...
                // Deploying the application using Helm Chart
                sh 'helm upgrade --install my-app ./my-helm-chart -f values.yaml'
            }
        }
    }
}
## Configuration Details

### Secrets Management

*   HashiCorp Vault is used to store and manage application secrets.
*   JWT keys are generated automatically by the Vault agent.
*   Encryption keys are secured using Google Cloud KMS.

### Service Discovery

*   Consul is used for service discovery, enabling dynamic discovery and communication between services.

### Scalability

*   Vault and Consul replicas ensure high availability and resilience.
*   Application services can be scaled horizontally as needed.

### Security

*   Encryption of keys using Google Cloud KMS ensures data security.
*   Communication between services can be secured using TLS.

## Remarks

*   Remember to replace `values.yaml` with the appropriate configuration file.
*   Make sure Jenkins has the necessary permissions to deploy applications to the Kubernetes cluster.
*   It is recommended to use Pipeline as Code and store `Jenkinsfile` files in the code repository.
